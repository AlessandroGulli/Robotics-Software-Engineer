###  4. **Map My World** (Mapping and SLAM)
   - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) can be implemented in a number of ways depending on the sensors used via various ROS packages. Use a ROS SLAM package and simulated sensor data to create an agent that can both map the world around it, and localize within it. Skills apply: Mapping and SLAM algorithms, Occupancy Grid Mapping, Grid-based FastSLAM and GraphSLAM, ROS debugging tools, C++.

   - **How to run**:
